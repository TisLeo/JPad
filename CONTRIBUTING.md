Anyone is welcome to contribute (at least 6 months of experience in Java - and desirably Swing - is preferred). Please make sure to create your own uniquely named and [up-to-date](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) branch and keep within the app's coding style (*including [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/uk/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) comments!*). 

- Very minor changes, such as typos and such should be done via issues, not PRs. This includes both the JPad app, and also its resources such as the wiki page.
- Bugs can be reported via issues. **Make sure to read through the current issues to not make a duplicate.**
- When opening a PR, make sure you have a clear description of the contents changed, modified, added, or removed and an explanation as to why.
